Using CDN is usually faster as the browser loads the cached version of file extensions

If downloading manually/ locally then only the .min version of both the JS and CSS files are needed, not the whole folder - place the /min files  in your own JS/Style folders naturally - and the complete version of the fonts folder. Don't forget to make a jQuery file locally as well by downloading the latest version!

__Containers__

Add 15px padding

__Columns__

The default grid has 12 columns

*just a good tip tip to know*: Columns have a negative margin of -15px so remove any padding from containers

The class calls for col-SIZE-SPAN : column-when it stacks like 'm d'-how many columns

They also have a default of 30px gutters (15px on each side)
